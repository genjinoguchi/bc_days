My friend [Julian Kalogerakis]("https://github.com/juliankal") and I really love to play pool. Whenever I go over to his Upper West Side apartment to hang out and work, we always take some time off to go down to his basement and shoot some pool. The set is pretty battered -- two of the sticks are broken in half, and the rest have missing tips. More often than not, the chalk is missing. Yet, it does not detriment it much; it still remains the same game that we both know and love.

So, for our APCS final projects, we were introduced to 3D graphics using Processing. It was a no-brainer as to what we were going to build.


#Pool3D
##We built a full 3D pool simulator using Java/Processing, and Processing 3D libraries.

Core Features:

* Physics Engine. The physics are completely written from scratch, and include accurate ball collisions and spin.
* Look and Feel. The game sports extremely intuitive UI and UX. > and < are used for very large movements, while the mouse is used for very accurate aim. The balls all have skins on them that appear like thye are rolling as the ball travels.
* We are looking to port it to the Android and iPhone, and put it on the Google Play Store as well as the App Store.
