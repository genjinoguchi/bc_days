genjinoguchi.github.io
======================

This is the personal website for Genji Noguchi!

It's going to have a couple of features: 
*  Personal about page, and contact page.
*  Resume/CVS.
*  The current software (and a couple of hardware, but only a couple) that I'm working on, and those that I've finished.
*  A randomly-generated animation done through js-- check!
  
Swag to include
* Home page with a photo gallery maybe?
* Some js animations
* Parallax scrolling
* Flat, minimal design.
* Google keep-style post it notes. These should not be staticly made. -- Idea changed
* Use a really special about page. Maybe a play (use jackcheng.com/about for inspiration)

Things to fix
* That super ugly about panel.
* I'd like the tabs to slide in as cards (google :D)
* Finish the project pages (possibly use bootstrap to speed things up?)
