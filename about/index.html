				<h1>My name is Genji Noguchi, and ...</h1>
				<p>
					I'm a New York native, Entrepreneur from Learning Curve Startup Accelerator, and hacker studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley.

					<br><br>

					My first real experience with engineering and technology was in my sophomore year, in which I
					took my first computer science course at <a href="https://stuy.enschool.org">Stuyvesant High School</a>.
					It was also the year in which I joined the Science Olympiad Robot Arm team (<a href="http://www.brianch.uk/projects/robotic_arms.html">more</a>),
					where I got my first experience with building things, circuits, and tying it all together with
					software on the Arduino.

					<br><br>

					My love for technology and building things only grew from there. I went to my first <a href="https://codeday.com">hackathon</a>
					in January of 2014, and have gone to 10 hackathons since, going as far as Canada for <a href="http://hackthenorth.com">Hack the North</a>.
					I got my first Android phone, an LG Optimus G Pro, and tinkered the
					crap out of it (nearly bricked it so many times). I led the team competing for Mission Possible, a Science Olympiad event
					about building a Rube Goldberg machine. Now, I'm on a team building an Android app to help connect people together,
					under <a href="http://www.mobiledevsberkeley.org/">Mobile Developers of Berkeley</a>.

					<br><br>

					But, in order to build even cooler things, you need to get more knowledge to do so. Thus birthed my love for learning
					about the unknown.
					I spend a lot of my free time keeping myself updated with the latest tech news, watching and reading tutorials
					of concepts that I want to explore, and building projects to solidify my understanding.

					<br><br>

					But, as much as I like to take learning into my own hands, there's no denying the sheer amount of knowledge
					I've acquired from just one semester at UC Berkeley. Just imagine: Surface integrals, Stoke's theorem, a Scheme interpreter
					in Python, solving systems of equations with linear algebra, and even implementing LTE using signal processing, all in four
					short months!

					<br><br>
					<br><br>

					Technology-related things aside, I'm an avid <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/genjinoguchi">photographer</a>, tennis player,
					and flautist. I also enjoy ultimate frisbee, billiards, and bombing hills on my cruiser.
