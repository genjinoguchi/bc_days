<p>Let’s face it, everybody hates waiting in lines. Especially for food. You’re standing there– inches away from the panini or pizza or whatever that you’re going to gulp down the second that it’s handed to you– and you can’t help but wonder if there is a better way, especially in this high-tech world of ours where anything is possible.</p>

<h1 id="we-have-a-solution-called-lineless">We have a solution called <em>Lineless</em>.</h1>

</center>

<p>Here is how it works: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Find a restaurant that is a partner of Lineless</li>
  <li>Choose the food you want on the website, and finish and pay using Venmo.</li>
  <li>When the order is almost done, you will receive a text message saying that it is time to go the restaurant.</li>
  <li>Arrive at the restaurant, immediately receive a table, and pig out. Or, if you’re not a very public-place kind of person, then take it out.</li>
</ol>
