Possible libraries to use:
* Sketch.js (https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js): An easy way to make flowery, flashy animations based on mouse movements.
* Lettering.js (): A small jQuery plugin that makes it easy to style lettering, letter by letter.
				   It will be good to pair it with CSS nth-child selectors (http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_nth-child.asp)
