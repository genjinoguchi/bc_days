If I had to point to the one thing in high school that I spent the most time on, it would probably be this.


##Overview
Mission Possible is an event under [Science Olympiad](http://soinc.org), a nationwide science and technology competition that exists for middle and high schoolers.

The build/study season for the [Stuyvesant Science Olympiad Team](http://stuyscioly.github.io) starts from September, and the first competition is in the following February.


##The Rules
The competition for MP works with a team-built [Rube Goldberg Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine).

What is a Rube Goldberg machine? It is a machine that takes a simple initial action, does a sequence of tasks far more complicated than the original, all leading up to one final task, which tends to be relatively simple as well.

As such, key points about the machine are: the starting task, the final task, and the steps in between.

##Without further ado,
the rules in a nutshell (based on those for the 2013 - 2014 season) :

 * Everything that happens must occur inside a virtual box at most 60cm * 60cm * 60cm, but the smaller the better. More on scoring later.
 * The entire sequence starts with one person pouring an even mixture of 10 golf tees, paper clips, and marbles.
 * The final task is to turn on some sort of light.
 * The steps in between are categorized by the type of &#39;energy transfer&#39; that they undergo:
	 * The in-between steps all need to change one form of &#39;energy&#39; into another.
	 * The types of energy are as follows:
		 * Mechanical Energy
		 * Thermal Energy
		 * Electrical Energy
		 * Electromagnetic Energy
		 * Chemical Energy
 * The entire sequence has a hard cap at 3 minutes.
