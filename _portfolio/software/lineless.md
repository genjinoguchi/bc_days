Let's face it, everybody hates waiting in lines. Especially for food. You're standing there-- inches away from the panini or pizza or whatever that you're going to gulp down the second that it's handed to you-- and you can't help but wonder if there is a better way, especially in this high-tech world of ours where anything is possible.

#We have a solution called *Lineless*.

Here is how it works:

1. Find a restaurant that is a partner of Lineless
2. Choose the food you want on the website, and finish and pay using Venmo.
3. When the order is almost done, you will receive a text message saying that it is time to go the restaurant.
4. Arrive at the restaurant, immediately receive a table, and pig out. Or, if you're not a very public-place kind of person, then take it out.
